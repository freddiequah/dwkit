# Event Registry

## Version
v1.0

## Purpose
This document is the canonical registry of all project events.
If an event is not registered here first, it does not exist.

## Rules
- All event names MUST start with EventPrefix.
- Payload fields are contracts. Any payload change requires explicit acknowledgement.
- Producers/consumers should be recorded where known.
- Until EventPrefix is finalized, no new events should be introduced.

## Canonical Identity Status
- EventPrefix: TBD (not yet locked)

## Events
None.

Reason:
- EventPrefix is not finalized yet, so event names cannot be made compliant.
