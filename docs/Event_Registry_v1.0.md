# Event Registry

## Version
v1.1

## Purpose
This document is the canonical registry of all project events.
If an event is not registered here first, it does not exist.

## Rules
- All event names MUST start with EventPrefix.
- Events MUST be registered here before being introduced in code.
- Payload fields are contracts. Any payload change requires explicit acknowledgement.
- Producers/consumers should be recorded where known.

## Canonical Identity Status
- EventPrefix: DWKit: (LOCKED)

## Events
None.

Reason:
- No events have been introduced yet.
- Event bus / event emitter surface is not implemented yet (docs remain the source of truth until then).
